                    <h2>About us</h2>
                    <p>
                        On Behalf of Richard and Siripan Johnson Welcome to our Website.
                        We are a Husband & Wife team who pride ourselves on creating a friendly
                        and relaxed atmosphere for our customers to just sit back and enjoy the food that we prepare.

                        The name Thairish was a play on words between us as Siripan came to Ireland from Thailand and
                        worked in a Country
                        Club as Head Chef for 5 years. After friends & family (and myself) had repeatedly told Siripan
                        that she was
                        wasting her culinary gifts there and should open up her own premises she finally agreed. I was
                        determined to
                        back her all the way and so we both decided to make it a family business and just run with it.
                        So with us both
                        Thai & Irish it became the name we trade under and Thairish was born.

                        2 years later we made the decision to open a second cafe in Carrigtwohill, where we brought the
                        same service,
                        relaxed & friendly atmosphere and of course the great tasting food that our customers in
                        Carrigaline have come
                        to depend on us for since we opened in December 2010. However our own family grew and the
                        demands of running two
                        establishments left us little time with our children so we both made the decision to put family
                        first and let one cafe go.

                        Now we have grown our business even more and added another 46 seats to our restaurant doubling
                        its size so we can
                        better cater to the needs of our customers.

                        We would like to thank the people of Carrigtwohill for accepting us into their community and
                        also of course like
                        to thank all our old customers in Carrigaline who have brought us smiles and laughter and helped
                        to make our business a success.
